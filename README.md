# Maya - Pipeline Shelf Tools

## Tool Summary

4 maya shelf tools to automate frequent repetitive tasks. It implements a simple pipeline / 
versioning system to prevent manual file saving / loading / naming, and enforces the 
specified naming convention.

1. set project - Custom set project with custom folder names, also saves current file
as version 1.
2. open project - Automates opening the latest version of a specific project in a 
specific topic.
3. version up - Automates saving the current file as the next version while preserving previous versions and the naming convention.
4. version toggle - Allows toggling between different versions of the current project
file from within maya.

## Note

These shelf tools were solely written for specific uses within a personal project 
and within a short amount of time. In the future, I will add 
error checking and testing to make it more reliable. But the main logic is there :)

## I will add more details soon
